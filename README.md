<h2>Validators and Errors :</h2>

<p>?HTML and CSS checks were passed with flying colors. Javascript had couple of warning. As they are not errors I left them there as my skill level is not adequate to understand what is the problem. Also I have been working whole night and I have to submit this work in less than 3 hours.</p>

<h2>Known Problems :</h2>

<p>I was so focused on making this project that I didn't even think that making it on the 4k screen would have consequences. I have just finished fighting with the CSS media to adjust the sizes to lower width devices. Making the original for 4k I have made a blunder and now it's hard to shrink it down. I can probably just set the original page size and its a fairly simple problem, but due to lack of time I have just adjusted the best I could for the smaller devices and that will have to do. I hope that won't be too much of an issue. To be fair, It works quite well on devices until 750px width, if we start to go lower than the problem arises. Most modern devices should work fairly well :)</p>

<h2> The dificult part </h2>

<p>I got through the javascript at a decent rate I  would say but making this project hasn't been an easy task. I have been working on alternative knowledge for a week now, watching all possible javascript tutorial videos and browsing stackoverflow to get to the grips of jacascript. My main problem is that there is so many options how to do one thing, that even if I grasp one concept I watch the next video and some other bloke is telling me how to do the exact thing in completely different solution. </p>


<h2>Deployment</h2>

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab

<h2>Materials Used</h2>

www.w3schools.com has been a great source and I have been using it quite a bit formating CSS, great wealth of knowledge there. 
www.youtube.com for the past week I probably have watched all javascript videos on how to make simple game and use random number generators. 
codeinstitute Love Math project has been a great inspiration and going over all the course materials has helped greatly !
